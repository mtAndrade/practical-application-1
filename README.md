Summary of findings: 
One relationship that we can infer by this data analysis is that people who visit bars frequently are more likely to accept coupons. At an average of ~70% more than non-frequent drivers.
Age also represents a important factor since drivers with less than 25 years are less than 30 are more likely to accept coupons.
The last analysis tells us that people who work in farming, fishing and forestry ar less likely to accept bar coupons.
